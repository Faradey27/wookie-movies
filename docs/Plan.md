# My initial plan about how I am gonna develop the app

1. Analyze requirements
2. Ask questions, research technical stack, prepare some ideas about what to use and why 
3. Setup empty project with all ready-to-use infra (tests, lint, potential CI)
4. Setup API layer and check that everything ready to use
5. Setup data layer and check that it is ready to use
6. Implement early version of the app with all critical features that required (no design, maybe some mocked data), where I can find main problems and identify some miss things + make sure that all previous infra works fine
7. Iteration to fix infra and issues that may appear
8. Basic tests coverage(Ideally I prefer to work in TDD way, but in order to speedup development, I will do tests after)
8. Apply design to the app, make main features more beauty + work better
9. Iteration to refactor app, fix some bugs, make sure that performance and design aligned
10. Add bonus features (favorite movie, more advanced search)
11. Cleanup application code, tests, design, prepare missed docs and submit task

Time limit for task: 5 hours
